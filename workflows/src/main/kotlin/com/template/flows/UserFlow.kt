/*
@InitiatingFlow     required by any flow that requests communication with a counterparty.
@StartableByRPC     This allows the flow to be called from an RPC connection which is the
                    interface between the outside of a Corda node and itâ€™s internals.
@Suspendable        This annotation is needed on all functions that communicate with a counterparty.
                    the annotation allows the function to be suspended while the counterparty is dealing
                    with their side of the transaction.
FlowLogic           contains one abstract function call that needs to be implemented by the flow.
call                When the flow is triggered, call is executed and any logic that put inside the
                    function runs.
